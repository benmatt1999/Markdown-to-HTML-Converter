# Markdown-to-HTML-Converter

Hello! This is Benjamin Thorne's homework assignment for my application to Mailchimp! This project was completed on 5/24/2023.

Just a quick overview of how it works, this is a flask application that creates a web page which allows you to either upload a markdown file (or any other text file for that matter) or just copy and paste your desired markdown text into a text box, and then after clicking upload, it will take you to another page displaying the converted html page.

To get the flask app to run, you may need to install Flask via pip (pip install flask). From there, all you need to do is run "flask run" in the application's base directory and the website should be running on http://127.0.0.1:5000. 

If you have any questions about this process, do not hesitate to reach out to me either by email (benmatt1999@gmail.com) or by phone (404-702-6133).

Thank you so much for your consideration!!!
